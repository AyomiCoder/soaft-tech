<hr>
<div class="note">
<h3>Founders and Earlier Versions</h3>

<p>
  In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to
   use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee 
   specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems 
   engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. 
   In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

<p>
  The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by
   Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. 
   Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup 
   Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.
</p>

<p>
  HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into 
  visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, 
  and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the 
  text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the 
  features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for 
  the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands
   used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements
    (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and
     markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
</p>

<p>
  Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering 
  Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
   Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to 
   define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic 
   browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful 
   prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, 
   suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
</p>

<p>
  After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed
   "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations 
   should be based.
</p>

<p>
  Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML 
  specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium 
  (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in 
  late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext
   Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed
    and standardized on 28 October, 2014.

<h2 class="headc" >Introduction to HTML</h2>
<hr>
<div class="note">
<h3>What is HTML?</h3>

<p>
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. <br>

    HTML stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b> <br>
    HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup <br>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages <br>
    HTML elements are represented by tags <br>
    HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on, You will get used to them as you learn <br>
    <br>
</p>


  <h4>This is how an HTML page looks like!. </h4>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/htm (1).png" alt="Html Template"> <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    The <code>!DOCTYPE html</code> declaration defines this document to the browser as HTML5 (Doesn't have a closing tag) <br>
    The <code>html</code> element is the root element of an HTML page (it has an opening tag and a closing tag) <br>
    The <code>head</code> element contains meta information about the document (it has an opening tag and a closing tag) <br>
    The <code>title</code> element specifies a title for the document, ie the text that showd on the tab (it has an opening tag and a closing tag) <br>
    The <code>body</code> element contains the visible page content, this is where all content of the page would be (it has an opening tag and a closing tag) <br>
    The <code>h1</code> element defines a large heading(it has an opening tag and a closing tag) <br>
    The <code>p</code> element defines a paragraph (it has an opening tag and a closing tag) <br>
    The syntax would be explained better in the next topic..
</p>
<br>

<h4>This is a visualisation of an HTML Structure. </h4>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/htm (2).png" alt="Html Template" width="700px" height="400px"> <br>
<br>
<p>
  This page structure is clearly shown on the white space on the image above <br>
  All contents of your website goes inside the <code>body</code> tag. <br>
  Tags also comes in pairs Except from the <code>!Doctype html</code>
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note!</strong>Only the content inside the <body> section (the white area above) is displayed in a browser.
</div>
<h4>You would need a web browser</h4>
<p>
  The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari etc) is to read HTML documents and display them. <br>

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document: <br>
This is how a browser displays your code
</p> <br>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note!</strong> You can use chrome as your default browser

</div>

<h2 class="headc" >HTML Editors</h2>
<hr>
<div class="note">
<h4>You can write HTML codes with a text editor, a text editor is an app that helps you save your code and edit them.</h4> <br>
<p>
  We have a lot of Text editors but i would recommend Visual Studio Code: <br>
  Visual studio code is a product of the Microsoft corporation and its easy to use for beginners.
</p>
<h4>How to install?</h4> <br>
<p>Click on this link below to download the Vscode .exe set up, <code>make sure you are connected to an active Network</code></p>
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download Vscode</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  After download, double click on the file and follow necessary procudures by the app. Then open after installation <br>
  Now you have a Code editor! <br>
  something like this should show after opening the app
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/vscode.jpg" alt="vs code" height="600px" width="700px"> <br>
<br>
<p>
  Now go to your desktop by pressing <code>"windows key + D" </code> and create a new folder, just right click on an empty space, select "new" and click "Folder" <br>
  you can rename it with any name you like.
  After creating the folder, add the folder to Visual code by clicking "Open folder".
  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/vscode2.jpg" alt="vs code" height="600px" width="700px"> <br>
<br>
After clicking open folder, this will pop up, then navigate to the desktop and select your folder.
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/vscode3.jpg" alt="vs code" height="600px" width="700px"> <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
  After adding your folder press <kbd>ctrl + N</kbd> to create a new file, name the file <code>index.html</code> 
  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/vscode4.jpg" alt="vs code" height="600px" width="700px"> <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now you can write these following code in your code editor as shown below. Press <code>ctrl + s</code> to save
  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/vscode5.jpg" alt="vs code" height="600px" width="700px"> <br>
<br>
</p>

<strong><h4>How to view your code ouput in the browser?</h4></strong>
<br>
<p>
  Go to desktop, locate your folder.
  <br>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/desk.png" alt="vs code" height="400px" width="500px"> <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Open your folder and double-click on the index file.
  <br>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/file.png" alt="vs code" height="400px" width="500px"> <br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
  This is your result in the browser.
